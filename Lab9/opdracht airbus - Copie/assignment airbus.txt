Assignment Airbus
-----------------

You are given a base html page that already contains the content, and a folder with the images.

Create a webpage as described below and illustrated in the given screenshot.

You will have to edit the given html page and add a css file.

Things to remember :

 - Wherever possible, you have to replace the elements in the given html with their semantic counterparts

 - Write your selectors as generic as possible, so avoid id attributes if they are not absolutely necessary. If you need class attributes, give them semantic names.
